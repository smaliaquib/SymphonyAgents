# 🎼 SymphonyAgents

An intelligent multi-agent orchestration system that harmonizes AI agents to work together seamlessly, creating a symphony of automated intelligence.

## 📋 Overview

SymphonyAgents is a powerful framework for building and orchestrating multiple AI agents that collaborate to solve complex tasks. Like a conductor leading an orchestra, SymphonyAgents coordinates specialized agents, each with unique capabilities, to achieve sophisticated goals through intelligent collaboration.

## 🎯 Features

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Coordinate multiple specialized agents working in harmony
- **Intelligent Task Distribution**: Automatically route tasks to the most capable agents
- **Collaborative Problem Solving**: Agents work together, sharing context and insights
- **Modular Architecture**: Easily add, remove, or customize agents for your needs
- **Scalable Design**: Handle complex workflows with multiple concurrent agents
- **Real-time Coordination**: Agents communicate and synchronize in real-time

## 🏗️ Architecture
